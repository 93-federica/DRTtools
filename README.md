# DRTtools

We are pleased to introduce the DRTtools, an open-source Matlab toolbox for computing distribution relaxation times (DRT) from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data. 

What is the DRTtools? Why would I want it?

DRTtools is a Matlab toolbox that analyzes EIS data via the DRT model. DRTtools features:

- an intuitive GUI for computing DRT based on Tikhonov regularization

- several options for optimizing the estimation of the DRT

Hopefully, by now you are inclined to think that this toolbox may be useful to the interpretation of your EIS data. If you are interested, you will find an explanation of the toolbox's capabilities it in the user's guide as well as in the references below.

# **Distribution and Release Information**

DRTtools is freely available under the MIT license from this site.

# **System requirements**

To install and run the DRTtools, you need:

Matlab 7.12 or above
Optimization toolbox of Matlab
The DRTtools toolbox was tested and implemented on a Windows-based machine. 

Detailed installation instructions are available in the DRT toolbox user's guide (also included with the standard distribution).
