# DRTTOOLS

We are pleased to introduce the DRTTOOLS, a free Matlab toolbox for computing distribution relaxation times (DRT) from impedance spectroscopy (IS) data.
DRTTOOLS features:

an intuitive GUI for computing DRT based on Tikhonov regularization
a wide variety of options for optimizing the estimation of DRT
What is the DRTTOOLS? Why would I want it?

DRTTOOLS is a Matlab toolbox which analyzes IS data via DRT.

Hopefully, by now you are inclined to think that this toolbox may actually be useful to you for the interpretation of your IS data via DRT. If you are interested, you'll find a detailed explanation of the toolbox's capabilities it in the user's guide, and in the references below.

#**Distribution and Release Information**

DRTTOOLS is freely available under the GNU license from this site.

#**System requirements**

To install and run the DRTtools, you need:

Matlab 7.12 or above
Optimization toolbox of Matlab
The DRTtools toolbox was tested and implemented on a Windows-based machine. 

Detailed installation instructions are available in the DRT toolbox user's guide (also included with the standard distribution).
